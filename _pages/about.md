# Xinyi Zhuang (Â∫ÑÊñ∞‰∏Ä)
Hi, I'm a second-year direct-track Ph.D. student at the School of Information Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen.
I received my B.E. degree in Communication Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in 2023.
Now, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITsz), under the supervision of Prof. [Lin Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=41wcJi4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include Networks for Large AI models and AI for networking.

Feel free to contact me for communication and collaboration: <u>zhuangxinyi@stu.hit.edu.cn</u>
